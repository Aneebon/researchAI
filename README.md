🚀 Research Gap Finder & Idea Generator
A powerful AI-powered tool that helps you find research gaps and generate fresh research ideas in seconds—designed for students, researchers, and innovators.

🗂️ How It Works
1. Multi-Source Paper Retrieval
🔍 Enter your research topic

🌐 Fetches papers from arXiv and CORE—two of the largest open-access repositories

🆕 Ensures broad and up-to-date coverage across disciplines

2. AI-Powered Content Analysis
🧠 Uses Google Gemini AI for deep reading and synthesis

📄 Analyzes abstracts and summaries for trends, methods, and findings

🔎 Goes beyond simple limitations—provides deeper, insightful context

3. Smart Research Gap Detection
📊 Identifies:

⚪ Underexplored areas

🔗 Disconnected or isolated topics

❓ Missing, contradictory, or unclear findings

🗺️ Maps out gaps, trends, and innovation potential

4. AI-Driven Idea Generation
🎯 Based on gaps, AI proposes:

❓ New research questions

📝 Innovative project ideas

🚦 Quickly moves you from “what’s missing” ➡️ “what to do next”

5. Interactive Results Interface
📋 Displays results in a clean, readable format

⏱️ Synthesizes insights in seconds
